# Nahar 0.0.12
Simple (like Python) & Safe (like Rust).

## Format
There shall be 90 columns, and tabs are 6 spaces.  Why?  Because a lot of people really
hate 4 because it's too small and a lot really hate 8 because it's too big.  So 6 seems to
be a good middle point (it also, in my opinion looks the best because it's the easiest to
read).  6 also goes into 90 15 times, which if you're indenting that much you're doing
something wrong (80 is not enough, but you certainly don't need 100).  Since it's a
non-standard indentation (not 8) we must use spaces instead of tabs, unfortunately.

## Example
```nahar
#!nahar 0.0.12

# Lone expression evaluates & prints (this prints 2)
3 - (2 - 1)

# 2 ways to write parentheses:
# 1. As a 1-element vector
3 - {2 - 1}
# 2. As a 1-element tuple
3 - (2 - 1)
```

## Getting started
```nahar
# Define a constant `c` for 3-space big int vector
big.c : {1 2 3}

# Define a variable `a`
a s32 := {1 2 3}

# Mutate a variable `a`
a := 3 2 1
a += {1 2 3}

#
assert a = {4 4 4}

# 
var_a += {3 2 1}
# Make var_a immutable.
var_a.lock
# This won't compile now
swap var_a var_b
```

## Functions
```nahar
# Functions are defined the same way as variable.
my_function fn: opt      # Returns an option (`yes` or `no`).
            param_a @s32 # Pass by reference a signed 32 bit integer.
            param_b i_   # Pass by value an unknown-size integer.
{
      # Shorthand for `on opt.yes [`
      if param_a = s32(param_b).catch[range_err:param_a] != 0 {
            yes
      } else 1 = 2 = 2 {
            # This panic will never be triggered, unless you change 1 to 2 - then it will
            # be triggered while compiling.
            panic "1 does not equal 2 and does not equal 2, even though 2 does equal 2"
      } else {
            "param_a does not equal param_b"; no
      }
}


# 1 line (bad practice)
my_function T fn -> opt # Returns an option (`yes` or `no`). # (param_a @s32 # A \
pointer to a signed 32 bit integer. #, param_b u32, # Pass by value 32 bit \
integer. #): { /*â€¦*/ }
```

## Enums are Tagged Unions
```
# A union is defined with union[] - table
opt enum [
      no    : 0 # 
      yes t?: _ # 
]

# A union of types where all of the types have fields with same name.
any enum [
      {var}
]
```

## Structs
```
# A struct is defined with struct() - tuple
list struct(
      length   :u32      0   # This is how big the list is.
      capacity :u32      0   # This is how much space is allocated in `pointer`.
      pointer  :ptr(var) nil # A pointer to the place where the list actually is.
)
```

## Matches
```nahar
# Commas at end of lines are optional.
pos struct(x:u32 y:u32),
vec struct(x:u32 y:u32),
movement type: any(pos, vec),

a movement := pos(1, 2),
match a [
      pos: "({pos.x}, {pos.y})",
      vec: "({hex(vec.x)}, {hex(vec.y)})",
],
```

## Syntax List
```nahar
#! Set an project-wide attribute. `#!warn(no_docs)`
#? Compile only if an condition is met. `#? linux`
#  "Comment Open/Close" - This is like /* */ in some languages, but always ends
                          on the same line.
