# About
Code is linear and not compiled as a tree, even though file system suggests.  Published libraries
must be dual-licensed MIT/Boost.  Code will be checked at compile-time to make sure that nothing
can fail.  You can call the `fail` function to determine parts of the code you want to be
unreachable.  Code will also be checked at compile time for infinite loops - no function may have
an infinite loop.  In order to get a loop like a game loop you must use the `looper` function.
FFI is not included in the language on purpose because FFI is unsafe.  The standard library takes
care of interfacing to the system (which is done purely through stdout escape sequences that the
nahar engine interprets).  First function is entry point (the "main" function).
