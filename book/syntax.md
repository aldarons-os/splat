# Syntax

## Brackets
Due to 1-equivalence (a tuple of one item is equal to that item, an array of one
item is equal to that item), you may use any type of bracket as parentheses.
 - Tuple: `(1, "4")`
 - Array: `[1, 3, 5]`
 - Scope: `{ 1 }`
 - Table: `[4: "Hello", 8: "World"]`

## Literals
 - Text: `"Some Text"` (There is no "Character" in Aratar)
 - Integer: `4`
 - Decimal: `4.0` (The trailing `0` is required)
 - Hexadecimal: `0xFFFF`
 - Binary: `0b1100_0011` (Any number can use `_` to make it visually pleasing)
 
## Ranges
 - Inclusive Range (For Pattern Matching): `...`
